# Gym Member Segmentation for Targeted Marketing Strategy

## Overview
This project applies data-driven segmentation techniques to identify distinct gym member profiles and guide personalised marketing strategies.  
Using clustering models built in Python, the analysis explores how demographic and socioeconomic factors influence engagement, retention and purchasing behaviour — helping transform generic promotions into targeted campaigns.

## Objectives
- Analyse gym member demographic data to uncover key behavioural and socioeconomic patterns  
- Determine the optimal number of customer segments using the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis  
- Apply K-means++ and Agglomerative Clustering to group members with similar characteristics  
- Interpret and label customer segments to build actionable profiles  
- Develop data-driven marketing recommendations for each segment  

## Dataset
The dataset contains **2,000 gym member records** and **7 features**, including demographic and socioeconomic variables:

- Gender  
- Marital Status  
- Age  
- Education  
- Income  
- Occupation  
- Settlement Size  

All features are integer-coded. No missing values were found.  
Numerical variables (Age and Income) were standardised to ensure equal influence in clustering.

## Methodology

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
- Reviewed data completeness and variable types  
- Visualised distributions of key variables (age, income, gender, education, etc.)  
- Identified moderate right-skewness in income and age  
- Retained outliers for realistic representation  

### 2. Determining Optimal Clusters
The Elbow Method and Silhouette Scores indicated **k = 2** as the most appropriate segmentation level  
(highest silhouette score = **0.545**).

### 3. Clustering Models
- K-means++ and Agglomerative Clustering were applied to all variables  
- Both techniques produced consistent results with two well-defined customer segments  

## Results and Insights

### Segment 0: Younger, Lower-Income Single Men in Small Towns
- 63.6% male, mostly single (96.8%)  
- Average age: 33 years, lower education and income levels  
- Average income: $103,256  
- Occupations: mostly unskilled or unemployed  
- Location: small towns and regional areas  

**Interpretation:**  
Represents younger, price-sensitive customers focused on affordability and motivation.

**Marketing Strategy:**
- Bring a Friend Friday: Let members bring a friend for free every Friday to boost motivation, enjoyment, and organic referrals.
- First Month Half Price: Offer a 50% discount on the first month for students or those under 25 to lower the entry barrier and attract trial sign-ups.
- Flexible Pass Options: Introduce no-contract or short-term passes to appeal to those who value freedom and can’t commit to long-term plans.

### Segment 1: Mature, Affluent, Married Women in Big Cities
- 85.6% female, mostly married (99.3%)  
- Average age: 48 years, highly educated (mostly university or higher)  
- Average income: $173,460  
- Occupations: skilled to managerial roles  
- Location: large cities  

**Interpretation:**  
Represents mature, financially secure customers who value premium wellness experiences.

**Marketing Strategy:**
- Personal Training Starter Pack: Offer two free sessions to new or renewing members to encourage early commitment without pressure.
- Loyalty Month Bonus: Reward members with 6+ months of membership with a guest pass, towel service, or small merchandise to boost retention through appreciation.
- Premium Personalisation: Provide tailored workout tips or app-based routines to deliver a high-value, exclusive experience.

## Tools and Techniques
- **Language:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)  
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
- **Methods:** Standardisation, Elbow Method, Silhouette Analysis, K-means++, Agglomerative Clustering
